#### The ML Classification Model can be built using the R Script
     ML_Classification_R_Script.R

#### The prediction on external dataset can be combined and further used to built the array-type meta predictor based classifier using the following code.

- The Model01_CNN.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook can be used to train, validate and test the array-type meta predictor based on the input data with the shape of `50 * 4`.  
- The Model01_3D.ipynb: notebook can be used to train, validate and test the array-type meta predictor based on the input data with the shape of `(10 * 5 * 4 = 10 * 20)`. 
- The Model01_3D_Reshaped.ipynb notebook can be used to train, validate and test the array-type meta predictor based on the input data with the shape of `(5 * 10 * 4 = 5 * 40)`.

     `The input data to run the R Script and Jupyter Notebook is available under the data folder.`
