#### To run the array-type meta predictor based classifier, the following jupyter notebook can be used.

- The Model01_CNN.ipynb notebook can be used to train, validate and test the array-type meta predictor based on the input shape of 50 * 4.  
- The Model01_3D.ipynb notebook can be used to train, validate and test the array-type meta predictor based on the input shape of (10 * 5 * 4 = 10 * 20). 
- The Model01_3D_Reshaped.ipynb notebook can be used to train, validate and test the array-type meta predictor based on the input shape of (5 * 10 * 4 = 5 * 40).
